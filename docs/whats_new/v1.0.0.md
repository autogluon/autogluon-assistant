# üöÄ AutoGluon Assistant v1.0 ‚ÄúMLZero‚Äù

## What‚Äôs New

We are excited to present the AutoGluon-Assistant 1.0 release. Level up from v0.1: v1.0 expands beyond tabular data to robustly support any and many modalities, including **image, text, tabular, audio and mixed-data pipelines**. This aligns precisely with the MLZero vision of comprehensive, modality-agnostic ML automation.

### Official MLZero Launch 
[@FANGAreNotGnu](https://github.com/FANGAreNotGnu)

AutoGluon Assistant v1.0 is now synonymous with **"MLZero: A Multi-Agent System for End-to-end Machine Learning Automation"** ([arXiv:2505.13941](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13941)), the end-to-end, zero-human-intervention AutoML agent framework for multimodal data.
Built on a novel **multi-agent architecture** using LLMs, MLZero handles perception, memory (semantic & episodic), code generation, execution, and iterative debugging ‚Äî seamlessly transforming raw multimodal inputs into high-quality ML/DL pipelines.

#### Why It Matters
- **No-code**: Users define tasks purely through natural language ("classify images of cats vs dogs with custom labels"), and MLZero delivers complete solutions with zero manual configuration or technical expertise required.
- **Built on proven foundations**: MLZero generates code using established, high-performance ML libraries rather than reinventing the wheel, ensuring robust solutions while maintaining the flexibility to easily integrate new libraries as they emerge.
- **Research-grade performance**: MLZero is extensively validated across 25 challenging tasks spanning diverse data modalities, MLZero outperforms the competing methods by a large margin with a success rate of 0.92 (+263.6\%) and an average rank of 2.28.

| Dataset     | Ours | Codex CLI | AIDE | DS-Agent | AK |
|-------------|--------------------------|---------------|----------|--------------|--------|
| **Avg. Rank ‚Üì** | **2.42** | 8.04 | 5.76 | 6.16 | 8.26 | 8.28 | 
| **Rel. Time ‚Üì** | **1.0**  | 0.15 | 0.23 | 2.83 | N/A  | 4.82 | 
| **Success ‚Üë**   | **92.0%** | 14.7% | 69.3% | 25.3% | 13.3% | 14.7% | 
</div>

- **Modular and extensible architecture**: We separate the design and implementation of each agent and prompts for different purposes, with a centralized manager coordinating them. This makes adding or editing agents, prompts, and workflows straightforward and intuitive for future development.

### Brand-new WebUI and MCP

We‚Äôre also excited to introduce the newly redesigned WebUI in v1.0, now with a streamlined chatbot-style interface that makes interacting with MLZero intuitive and engaging:

- **Upload & Describe:** Drag your data folder into the chat input, then simply type your task (e.g., "train a classifier for churn prediction"). Whether uploading a ZIP of CSV files or typing instructions, the WebUI transforms complex AutoML workflows into a ML solution.

- **Configure:** Easily set your model provider and credentials via the Settings panel.

- **Live log:** Watch real-time logs from data perception to planning and execution, all visualized directly in the browser.

- **Visualization and downloadable results:** View key outputs and download trained models, prediction results and generated codes with a single click.

Furthermore, we‚Äôre also bringing MCP (Model Control Protocol) integration to MLZero, enabling seamless remote orchestration of AutoML pipelines through a standardized protocol:

- **Distributed deployment:** Run your ML backend on powerful EC2 instances while controlling it from your local machine ‚Äî or keep everything local for development.

- **LLM-ready tools:** Expose AutoML capabilities as MCP tools that any LLM can understand and execute, from Claude to GPT-4 to open-source models.

- **Natural language control:** Connect Bedrock, OpenAI, or any LLM provider to orchestrate complex ML workflows through conversational interfaces.

- **Transparent pipeline:** Watch as your prompts transform into uploaded data, running tasks, and downloaded results ‚Äî all through a single `run_autogluon_pipeline` tool.

- **Flexible architecture:** Deploy servers across machines, configure tunneling as needed, or run everything locally ‚Äî MCP adapts to your infrastructure.

This MCP integration transforms MLZero into a universally accessible ML service ‚Äî turning any LLM into your personal AutoML assistant.

### Getting Started

AutoGluon Assistant is supported on Python 3.8 - 3.11 and is available on Linux (will fix dependency issues for MacOS and Windows by our next official release).

```bash
pip install autogluon.assistant
```
or install with uv (recommend):
```bash
pip install uv
uv pip install autogluon.assistant==1.0
```

To use CLI:
```bash
mlzero -i <input_data_dir>
```

To start the webUI:
```bash
mlzero-backend   # command to start backend
mlzero-frontend  # command to start frontend on 8509 (default)
```

To start the MCP:
1. Start the server
```bash
cd autogluon-assistant
mlzero-backend # command to start backend
bash ./src/autogluon/mcp/server/start_services.sh # This will start the service‚Äîrun it in a new terminal.
```
2. Start the client
```bash
cd autogluon-assistant
python ./src/autogluon/mcp/client/server.py
```

You are solving this data science tasks of binary classification: 
The dataset presented here (the Software Defects Dataset) comprises a lot of numerical features. We have splitted the dataset into three parts of train, valid and test. Your task is to predict the defects item, which is a binary label with 0 and 1. The evaluation metric is the area under ROC curve (AUROC).
